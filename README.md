   TrickyAnimationComponents**](https://github.com/TrickyFatCat/TrickyAnimationComponents);
3. `ActivationDistance` - determines the distance from the target actor the `ActivatePickup` function will be called.
   Worked only if `InterpolateToTarget == true`;

1. `ActivatePickup` - activates the pickup logic. Call this function if you want to activate the pickup in your custom
   pickup class;
2. `EnablePickup` - enables pickup if it was disabled when `DestroyOnActivation == false`;
3. `PickupEffect` - a function which is called to activate the actual pickup effect. Override it to implement pickup
   effect;

#### Delegates

some strange behavior.
